# AGENTS.md

## Scope

Instructions in this file apply to the repository root (`dcn-server-cpp`) and all subdirectories.

## Repository Structure

Key directories in this repository:

- `src/` - C++ implementation of the DCN server
- `include/` - public/internal header files
- `tests/` - unit/integration tests
- `cmake/` - CMake helper modules
- `resources/` - runtime resources and supporting data
- `submodule/pt/` - PT protocol Solidity repository (git submodule)

## Multi-Repository Context

This workspace contains two primary repositories with different ownership:

- `submodule/pt` is the Solidity PT protocol and is the **source of truth** for protocol behavior.
- `dcn-server-cpp` (this repository) is a C++ REST API server that interacts with the PT protocol.

When protocol behavior is unclear, agents should treat `submodule/pt` as authoritative and ensure server-side behavior aligns with it.

## Build Directory Policy

Agents must use a build directory for all work:

- `build-agent` for CMake build files
- `install-agent` for install output (`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install-agent`)

## Build/Test Flags

When building tests, always configure CMake with these options:

- `-DDECENTRALISED_ART_BUILD_TESTS=ON`
- `-DDECENTRALISED_ART_USE_SUBMODULE_PT=ON`

Use build configuration Debug or RelWithDebInfo.

The unit test build target is:

- `DecentralisedArtServerTests`

## Test Rebuild Policy

Do **not** rebuild tests by default for every change.

## Build/Test Execution Gate

Do **not** run build or test commands automatically after making changes.

Only run build/test commands when the user gives an explicit command/request to do so.

Examples of gated commands include:

- `cmake --build ...`
- `ctest ...`
- running `DecentralisedArtServerTests` directly

Rebuild `DecentralisedArtServerTests` when at least one of these is true:

- Any file under `src/`, `include/`, or `tests/` changes (`.cpp`, `.hpp`, etc.)
- CMake/test wiring changes (`CMakeLists.txt`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt`, `cmake/*.cmake`)
- Generated/build inputs for tests changed (protobufs, linked dependency config, compile options)
- `submodule/pt` changes affect server behavior or test expectations

Skip test rebuild when changes are non-compiled only, for example:

- Documentation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, docs)
- Static resources/UI assets only (`resources/html`, `resources/js`, `resources/styles`, images), unless tests explicitly depend on them
- Pure formatting/comment-only edits in files that do not alter compiled/tested behavior

When rebuild is needed, prefer incremental verification:

- Build `DecentralisedArtServerTests`
- Run only relevant test cases first (targeted filter)
- Run broader/full test pass only when the scope of changes justifies it
