     * @brief Materialises finalised registry events from the hot-store changelog into the
     *        Registry database, using an independent change_seq cursor persisted in the
     *        registry DB.  Implements events::IEventProjector so it can be driven by the
     *        existing EventsRuntime projection loop.
     *
     * Cursor policy:
     *   - cursor is loaded from the registry DB at construction and persisted after each
     *     batch (only if at least one row was consumed or skipped).
     *   - non-finalized rows (observed/safe/removed) are skipped; their change_seq is
     *     still advanced past because they will re-surface with a higher change_seq when
     *     they reach "finalized".
     *
     * Failure policy (per _materializeOne):
     *   - success / already present → cursor advanced.
     *   - failure (undecodable log, divergence, add rejection) → cursor is left before
     *     the row and the row is retried on subsequent projectBatch passes, so transient
     *     failures (e.g. busy registry DB) heal on their own. After
     *     ProjectorRetryConfig::max_attempts consecutive failing passes the row is
     *     dead-lettered (REGISTRY_DEAD_LETTER_BIT in the hot store) and the cursor
     *     advances past it: a permanently parked cursor would freeze the prune
     *     watermark for every projector and grow the hot store without bound.
     *     Dead-lettered rows are exempt from pruning, so no chain event data is lost;
     *     a periodic idle-time sweep (ProjectorRetryConfig::sweep_interval_ms) retries
     *     them and clears the bit once materialization succeeds. If the dead-letter
     *     mark itself cannot be written, the cursor stays parked.
